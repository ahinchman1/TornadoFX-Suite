Testing has always been a challenge for engineers - many of us are opiniated on how testing should affect our development process and what ought to be tested in applications. While we will do our best to update as we go both in our issues and on here, TornadoFX-Suite is a WIP which will exist in 3 stages:

* Stage 1: finding ways for Kotlin to create code-that-creates-code
* Stage 2: creating a DSL to create an easy structure for writing tests
* Stage 3: using machine-learning to learn what makes more useful testing rules
